# PolyVerge Flux Cipher (PVFC)

## Introduction

PolyVerge Flux Cipher (PVFC) is an advanced encryption algorithm designed to provide robust security through complex operations and flexible key management. This algorithm stands out for its ability to utilize an infinite number of keys, making it highly adaptable to various security requirements.

## Key Features

1. **Multi-Key Support**: PVFC can work with any number of keys, from a single key to potentially infinite keys, allowing for scalable security.

2. **Base Conversions**: The algorithm employs multiple base conversions, including decimal, hexadecimal, and base-36, adding layers of complexity to the encryption process.

3. **Bit-level Operations**: PVFC utilizes bit-shifting and XOR operations, enhancing the scrambling of data at the binary level.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**: The use of modular arithmetic throughout the algorithm ensures a high degree of non-linearity in the encryption process.

5. **Multi-Stage Transformation**: Both encryption and decryption involve multiple stages of data transformation, increasing the difficulty of unauthorized decryption.

6. **Character-to-Number Mapping**: The algorithm includes a unique method of mapping characters to numbers and vice versa, adding an extra layer of obfuscation.

7. **Dynamic Shuffling**: PVFC incorporates a dynamic shuffling mechanism based on the keys, further complicating the relationship between plaintext and ciphertext.

## How It Works

1. The input string is converted to a numerical representation.
2. Multiple keys are generated (the number and length of keys are customizable).
3. The encryption process involves:
   - Interleaving the keys
   - Applying a series of mathematical operations (addition, XOR, bit-shifting)
   - Shuffling the resulting data
   - Converting to a base-36 representation
4. The decryption process reverses these steps to recover the original data.

## Use Cases

- Secure communication systems
- Data protection in storage systems
- Cryptographic protocols requiring high flexibility
- Applications needing scalable security through additional keys

## Implementation

The algorithm is implemented in Python, demonstrating its functionality with encryption and decryption functions. The code includes helper functions for character-to-number conversion, key generation, and the main encryption/decryption logic.

## Security Considerations

While PVFC offers a high degree of complexity and flexibility, it's important to note that it's a custom encryption algorithm. As with any custom cryptographic solution, it should undergo thorough security analysis and testing before being used in critical applications.
